# PyBullet Racecar Common Extension

This folder contains the shared C++ extension entry points used by the PyBullet racecar example.

- `extension.hpp`
- `extension.cpp`

The code was moved from top-level `ext/` so example-specific extension code now lives under `examples/`, similar to `webots_epuck_common`.
